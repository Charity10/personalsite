      <h2>Computer Engineering student, Software Engineer</h2>
      <p>I love building websites that are awesome to look at and fun to use. ReactJS is my weapon of choice when it comes to creating these interactive experiences. Beyond coding, I find purpose in fostering vibrant tech communities and guiding aspiring developers. When I&apos;m not coding, you might find me editing videos</p>
